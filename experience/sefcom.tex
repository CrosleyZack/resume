\subsection{Student Researcher}
\paragraph{Security Engineering for Future Computing Lab,Arizona State University,Jul 2017 -- Aug 2019}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked with Professor Adam Doupé applying inductive programming to software security.
    \item Worked with members of SEFCOM lab to generalize inductive programming technique presented in paper by Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft). Methodology uses Directed Acyclic Graph intersection to isolate operations that could result in individual characters of output.
    \item Created novel technique of synthesizing exploits from samples in Capture the Flag (CTF) scenarios.
    \item Application sniffed network traffic using Scapy and categorized exploits, learned logic of exploit scripts from traffic using inductive programming, and attacked players with synthesized exploit.
    \item Developed Docker test suite to validate and demonstrate successful replication of exploit script logic.
    \item Documented research in thesis and presentation at Arizona State University. Research is ongoing and pending publication.
