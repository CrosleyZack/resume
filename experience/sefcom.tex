\paragraph{Security Engineering for Future Computing Lab,Arizona State University,Jul 2017 -- Aug 2019}
Worked with Professor Adam Doupé on research applying inductive programming to software security.
Worked with members of the SEFCOM lab to generalize inductive programming techniques for learning variety of problems.
Applied inductive programming library to recreate software logic without source code access.
Methodology uses Directed Acyclic Graph intersection to isolate operations that could result in individual characters of output.
Created novel technique of synthesizing exploits from samples in Capture the Flag (CTF) scenarios.
Utility sniffed network traffic using Scapy and split by port, learning logic of exploit script off incoming traffic by source.
Utility attacks players in CTF using learned exploits.
Utility components are docker instances for modularity.
Developed Docker test suite to validate methodology via successful replication of exploit script logic.
Documented research in thesis and presentation at ASU.
Research ongoing and pending publication.
