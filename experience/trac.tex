\subsection{Operations Research Analyst GS-12}
\paragraph{The Research and Analysis Center,Army Futures Command,May 2017 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Served as developer on a Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI), a stochastic (Monte Carlo), high resolution, closed-form, discrete event combat simulation.
    \item Developed a navigation suite in Python to aid in rapid implementation of maneuver behaviors. Library estimated to have saved hundreds of man hours of scenario development per scenario. 
    \item Created a graph data structure loaded from terrain, storing contextual data (trafficability, node or edge type) for nodes and edges to facilitate intelligent searching and knowledge representation.
    \item Optimized graph via functional programming approach with memoization and lazy evaluation.
    \item Implemented search methods (A*, Djikstra, Ant Colony Optimization) and heuristics to create paths.
    \item Designed path manipulation algorithms to produce unit maneuver order stacks.
    \item Developed Utility AI framework to enable user-defined utility measures (single, dual), considerations (state variables), normalizations, aggregation (combining components into utility measure), and selection methods based on publications by Kevin Dill (Lockheed Martin).
    \item Implemented autonomous behaviors using utility framework, such as engagement decisions.
    \item Developed terrain reasoning methodology as sequential discrete terrain sampling and utility evaluation based on paper by Eric Johnson (Electronic Arts).
    \item Utilized Terrain Reasoning to develop advanced behaviors, such as an automated tank defilade.
    \item Led efforts to develop high-fidelity Directed Energy Weapon COMBATXXI representation. Coordinated with external agencies and shareholders to define modeling requirements and approach.
    \item Led model development for an analysis alternative study. Attended study meetings to identify required model enhancements and coordinated with integration team on scenario implementation.
\end{itemize}

% Heuristics included utility-based path evaluation method to create tactically correct urban maneuvers.
% Navigation suite was used to speed up integration of combat scenarios by hundreds of hours each study.
% Developed administrative tool for COMBATXXI packaged scenarios to generate alternatives from a base scenario.
